# Oni: an OP Stack Bridge Interface

This project offers a flexible and intuitive interface for bridging assets to OP Stack rollups. It supports both standard ETH-based rollups and chains with custom gas tokens. For detailed information on custom gas tokens in the OP Stack, see the official [custom gas token docs](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/features/custom-gas-token).

## Features

- **Versatile Bridging**: Facilitates bridging to and from any OP Stack chain.
- **Custom Gas Token Compatibility**: Enables bridging to and from chains using custom gas tokens.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaindrop-raas/oni-bridge.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd oni-bridge
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

To enable custom gas token bridging, set the `VITE_L1_CUSTOM_GAS_TOKEN_ADDRESS` environment variable in the .env file to the address of the custom gas tokenâ€™s contract on the parent chain. If you prefer to use the native currency, set `VITE_L1_CUSTOM_GAS_TOKEN_ADDRESS` to the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`).

## Running in Development

1. Ensure the `.env` file is properly set up by copying it from `.env.example` and updating them as needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Compiling and Deploying for Production

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
2. Deploy the compiled files from the `dist` directory to your preferred hosting service as static assets.
